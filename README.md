# Bivariate-Poisson-Regression
Bivariate Poisson regression is intended for modeling when there is a pair of response variables in the form of count data that shows a high correlation value (Karlis &amp; Ntzoufras, 2005). Here I have 7 variables, where there are 2 dependent variables (Y) and 5 independent variables (X).
